## Polling App

```bash
Build a polling app for creating and participating in polls. Users can create
polls with multiple-choice questions, and others can vote on them. Display poll
results in real-time. Use React Router for navigating between polls.
Incorporate state management for polls and user interactions.
Constraints:
● Users must log in (sign in) before users can vote in a poll.
● Users can only see the results of a poll after users have voted in it.
● If you create a poll, you can view the poll's results, but you can't vote on
your own poll.
● Once users logged in, you can see all available polls and all poll results.
● Each user can only vote once on each poll.
● Registration and Login page.
● Display the poll results in Bar Chart format is preferable.
● Feel free to choose NoSQL DB or RDBMS
● Number of questions minimum 2, maximum 5
● Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and to
execute your app.
● Write unit tests for creating and voting on polls. (Integration test is not
required).
